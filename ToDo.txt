Pamehac:

Retabulate all to take into account NA could mean no fish or no effect.  Assume that 5 passes were made in all streams 1990, 1991, 1996 - need to find out if this is the case as some of the language in Scruton and Gibson suggests otherwise.  Scruton et al. 1998 says minimum of 4 passes.  

All of the above before proceeding with tabulation and comparisions
Consolidate sites (5 and 8)??  What about 9??

Kristin - binders to figure out location of dams and electrofishing - not sure if this is needed.

 - 
Get the sites below the stream diversion - emial sent to Kristin. - not sure if this is needed.

 
I think that many of the conclusions about electrofishing should be consisdered Pamehac only.  The other sites may 'behave' better.  I also need to follow up on the suggestion by Scott Reid that catchability estimates are something that a lit review would provide valuable info on and this could form the basis for a strong prior.

Done (sometimes, I delete these):
Then, create some nice tables like in notes (year x species-age wiht sites, total catch, sites with < 5, and more than three passes. 
Also, tabulations of T by year and species - done but get into a nice table; done; reorg so colum titles look nice in test tab: done
Looked at 5 sweeps and talk to Curtis/Clarke: done

Need a real total for Sites:Years:species - got this in df_tab2 which includes sites with only captures in sweep 1
Neil - location of dams - its just the diversion below Station 8
Proceed with T - see ReadMe for discussion
# Scale by pool size for analyses as required
Also, need to do a summary of why going with T and not all the other approaches
