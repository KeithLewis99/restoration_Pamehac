ToDo: 

Wins: dashboard, readme in markdown, and map function to replace loops - do multiple graphs instead of facet_grid for publication quality.  Dahsboard to Word.  struggle with glmm hurdle models, percent differences, signfificant zi terms, and BLUPs.

Done (sometimes, I delete these):
Looked at 5 sweeps and talk to Curtis/Clarke: done

Need a real total for Sites:Years:species - got this in df_tab2 which includes sites with only captures in sweep 1
Neil - location of dams - its just the diversion below Station 8
Proceed with T - see ReadMe for discussion
# Scale by pool size for analyses as required
Also, need to do a summary of why going with T and not all the other approaches
Get the sites below the stream diversion - emial sent to Kristin. - not sure if this is needed.


Assume that 5 passes were made in all streams 1990, 1991, 1996 - need to find out if this is the case as some of the language in Scruton and Gibson suggests otherwise.  Scruton et al. 1998 says minimum of 4 passes. CHECK THIS!!! Based on the data that I have, there were 18 cases where there were > 3 passes (all in 1990, 1991, 1996).  There were none in 1992 (not sure why) and Clarke said that by 2015, it was decided that > 3 passes was a waste of time.

Retabulate all to take into account NA could mean no fish or no effort.  NA means no fish at a Station where some fish were caught during a Sweep per species per year.  A blank line means that no fish of a given species were caught at that station in a given year.  df_a should account for this: if there was no effort, then there should be no row.  But if there was effort and there was a zero, then we need a row to account for this.  This is why we have hurdle models.


Kristin - binders to figure out location of dams and electrofishing - not sure if this is needed.  We didn't find anything.

Run ASYOY with binomial since ziGamma's aren't working nor is Tweedie. An interaction term cannot be used for ASYOY for Pamehac for the simple reason that there is no values for before:below:abun>1 and therefore, its inappropriate to use an interaction term in the model.  This explains why it works for the other species-age groups.  

Do percent differences for all. Log for gamma, plogis for binomial (not needed).  

If you just take the mean and sd of the T, then you get CIs < 0.  Probably need to get random effects. Figured this out - see Pam_figs_new.R.  Use Boot strap - was this done for Pamehac?

Consolidate sites (5 and 8)??  What about 9?? Eliminate "5B" - waiting on Kristin to reply.  Have moved ahead with making the code.  See ReadMe - remove stations.  Just need to talk to Kristin about 5A and maybe 8B.  Line 357 in the data.R is the key line for removing code.  Some issues I was having yesterday or not apparent today but this may have been due to coding fatigue which I seem to get after a while.
	- see meeting notes
Check AS diagnostics before proceeding - wait untilt he above is done.


Interaction term - did I do the percent differences right. See AS Biomass Interaction.
How do params line up with emmeans - they should!!  Influence of zeros
 - Yes. The code is a bit of a mess but I did show what parameters produce the various values in emmeans and therefore, that i'm doing this all correctly. I was able to recreate the response values in emmeans by exponentiating the conditional parameter estimates and doing a plogis (inverse logit) on the zi parameter values.  Got 2/4 so assuming the emmeans knows something I don't and going ahead with it.
