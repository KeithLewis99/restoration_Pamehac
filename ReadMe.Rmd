# Introduction
This file is simply a record of issues that I have had with the Pamehac analysis that was started by Kristin Loughlin and is a continuation of work begun by Dave Scruton.   See ReadMe files from Rose Blanche and Seal Cove for additional info.

# Notes

Got a zip file from Kristin Loughlin with no folders but files as follows:  
- Carle Strub Estimates    
- data in various formats  
- some R files for various plots  

I reorganized for my own needs.  I have recreated all teh figures although there are still questions, especially about the confidence intervals.



# Data
See the Rose Blanche code for explanations on what I think Kristin did and my concerns, i.e., how to use the delta method for tehse types of data as well as how the initial summaries were naively done.  
BUT......the really, really, really good thing for Pamehac is that there is a file "output_pamehac_by_station.csv" that has all of the data as derived from the AMEC functions but in raw form!!!  

Need a function to do this?


## Why are some CIs wide
Several reasons:
1. lack of data  - if only a few fish, often get NA
2. lack of depletion

On a more minor note:  
Are there any diagnostics or other concerns with the CS method?  
Why does the AMEC function not return its output aside from a graph and a csv file???

## abundance estimate 
After extensive exploration, it is clear that there is no "right" way to model abundance for all of the species:year:stations.

Few stations meet the T > 30 criteria in a given year
Some: CS approach is fine
Some: assumtions aren't met due to c2 > c1 or c1 ~ c2 >> c3.
Hedger approach seems to work in some cases but wildly off in others.  

GF > GF_crit is an indicator but SPC needs to be looked at too.

Need a tiered, measured approach
 - If T > 30 & GF < GF_crit and SPC looks OK (c1 > c2 > c3), then CS
    - If GF > GF_crit | SPC look bad, then 
      - if c1 << c2, then T (can't trust No and calibration will underestimate).  
      - if calibration >~ T and No, use calibration.  
      - if c1 ~ c2 >> c3, then T (can't trust No and calibration will overestimate)  
 - If T < 30 & T > 20 same as above
 - If T < 20 & T > 10: same as above
 - If T < 10 - then T == No almost all the time but why use CS as its not really valid.
